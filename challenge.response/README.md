# Challenge Response Protocol
This is a simple implementation of a Challenge/Response Protocol.

The Server binds to the given port and waits for a client connection (ipv6)<br>
On connection the server creates a pseudorandom byte stream and encrypts it with the client's public key.

The Client receives this bytestream (called Nonce) and decryptes it, with his private key. The encrypted Nonce is stored and encrypted again, this time with the server's public key.

The Server receives the Nonce again, decryptes it and compares it with the generated bytestream.
If they match, the client has been proven to be the client, as he was in possession of the private Key. The server itself was not challenged at all. So only the client was authenticated. See Needham-Schroeder Protocol for Server authentication.

The server initiates an AES-256-ofb encrypted channel and uses Â½ of the challenge as Initialization vector, the other half is used as Key.
